# C4 Notation

> Technical resources for using the C4 model for visualizing software architecture.

## What is This?

The contents of this repository should help you with putting the C4 model into action,
by providing relevant documentation, links, and technical artifacts (tools and media files).

Planned:

 * SVG notation shapes (for *yEd* or *InkScape*).
 * Documentation samples, possibly in notebook form.


## How to Use This?

**TODO**
